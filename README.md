# Improv Model Questionnaire

A simple questionnaire that scores participants on four improv styles (Principal, Director, Audience, Reviewer) and places them on a 2×2 quadrant.

## Running it

- **Best:** Use the **GitHub Pages** URL (see below). The live page runs over HTTPS and all features (totals, scoring, results) work correctly.
- Opening `index.html` directly from your computer (e.g. from Dropbox) can block or limit JavaScript, so the 0/5 totals and “See my results” may not work.

## Putting it on GitHub and getting a live link

1. **Create a GitHub account** (if you don’t have one): [github.com](https://github.com) → Sign up.

2. **Create a new repository**
   - Click **New** (or the **+** in the top right → **New repository**).
   - Name it something like `improv-questionnaire`.
   - Choose **Public**.
   - Do **not** add a README, .gitignore, or license (you already have files).
   - Click **Create repository**.

3. **Upload your files**
   - On the new repo page, click **“uploading an existing file”** (or drag and drop).
   - Upload `index.html` (and this README if you want).
   - Add a short commit message (e.g. “Add questionnaire”) and click **Commit changes**.

4. **Turn on GitHub Pages**
   - In the repo, go to **Settings** → **Pages** (left sidebar).
   - Under **“Build and deployment”**, **Source** choose **“Deploy from a branch”**.
   - **Branch**: `main`, folder **/ (root)**.
   - Click **Save**.

5. **Get your link**
   - After a minute or two, GitHub will build the site.
   - The URL will be: **`https://<your-username>.github.io/improv-questionnaire/`**  
     (use your GitHub username and the repo name you chose).
   - You can also see it under **Settings → Pages** as “Your site is live at…”.

Share that link and open it in a browser; the 0/5 totals and results will work when the page is loaded from that URL.
